               Encryption is a reversible transformation of information in order to conceal it from unauthorized persons, but providing at the same time access to it for authorized users. To

               become an authorized user and make the process truly reversible, e.g. - to be able to decrypt your files, you need to have a special private key. 
               <br />
               Additionally, you require the corresponding decryption software with which your files wil return to its original form.

               Think logically - we are the ones who have locked your files and the only ones who can decrypt your files. 
               <br />
               Any attempts to restore your files with third-party software or tools can be fatal for your encrypted files.
               <br />

                   Do not reboot your system as your core operating systems have been encrypted. Rebooting will make restoration of your system and files impossible.
